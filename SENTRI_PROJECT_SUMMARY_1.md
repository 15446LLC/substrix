# Sentri — Project Summary

## What Is Sentri?

Sentri is a web application that connects to QuickBooks Online (QBO) via the Intuit API and provides a **books health dashboard** — starting with reconciliation health as Module 1, with additional inspection modules to follow.

The name is a deliberate misspelling of "Sentry" — something standing watch over your books, catching problems before they become serious. It is short, ownable, and feels like infrastructure software.

---

## Product Vision

A modular books health platform, built one inspection module at a time. Each module inspects a different dimension of record quality. Together they build toward a full books health score.

**Target market:** Listed on the Intuit App Marketplace for use by bookkeepers, accountants, and business owners across any QBO company.

## Module 1 — Reconciliation Health Dashboard

Displays a list of all accounts that require reconciliation (bank accounts, credit card accounts, undeposited funds, cash) with the following health indicators per account:

| Indicator | Green | Yellow | Red |
|---|---|---|---|
| Last reconciled date | Within last 30 days | Within last 3 months | More than 3 months ago |
| Reconciliation integrity | Still intact | — | Has been broken |
| Unreconciled transactions prior to last rec date | None | Within 30 days before rec date | More than 30 days before rec date |
| Sum of unreconciled transactions | Displayed | Displayed | Displayed |
| Earliest unreconciled transaction date | Displayed | Displayed | Displayed |

## Future Modules (Planned)

- AR Health (aging, unapplied payments, open credits)
- AP Health (aging, bills paid without a bill)
- Uncategorized / Suspense Transactions
- Chart of Accounts Quality
- Payroll Liability Health
- Journal Entry Quality
- Bank Feed Health
- Closing & Period Discipline
- Fixed Assets & Depreciation
- Inventory Health (if applicable)
- Tax Line Mapping

## Status as of June 12, 2026

- **Deployed**: Sentri runs live at https://sentri-hefh.onrender.com (Render, free tier — spins down after inactivity, ~50s cold start).
- **GitHub**: source at github.com/15446LLC/sentri, `main` branch auto-deploys to Render.
- **Sandbox**: OAuth + dashboard verified end-to-end against Intuit sandbox company (4 accounts: Checking, Savings, Mastercard, Visa — all show "Never reconciled" since sandbox has no rec history).
- **Production credentials**: Unlocked via Intuit's App Details + Compliance questionnaire. Production Client ID/Secret added to Render env vars (`ENVIRONMENT=production`). Production redirect URI `https://sentri-hefh.onrender.com/callback` registered in Intuit.
- **Domain**: `sentri.15446.com` registered as host domain in Intuit App URLs (dev), but NOT yet pointed via DNS to Render — app URLs there are placeholders pending DNS setup. Live URL for now is the onrender.com one.
- **Not yet tested**: Real QBO account connection via production credentials (next step — click "Connect to QuickBooks" on the live URL and log in with real Intuit account).

### Known gaps / follow-ups
- Reconciliation integrity (broken-rec detection) — not built yet (planned v2 per notes above).
- No handling for expired refresh tokens / invalid grant errors — currently surfaces as generic 500.
- No CSRF state validation on OAuth callback (`state=sentri` is set but not checked).
- `intuit_tid` not captured from QBO response headers for support/troubleshooting.
- No in-app support/contact link.
- Sessions are in-memory (`express-session` with no store) — restarts log everyone out; fine for now, revisit before real users.

### QBO API Reconciliation Data — Known Limitation (as of 2026-06-15)
The QBO API does not expose reconciliation dates or clearing status through any of the following:
- `Account` entity: `LastReconciledDate` field does not exist (confirmed via query — "Property not found")
- `GeneralLedger` report: `clr_status` column not returned even when requested
- `TransactionList` report: same — no clearing status column
- `Purchase`/transaction entities: no `ReconcileStatus` field on individual transactions
- `ReconciliationDetail` report: returns error 5020 "Permission Denied" (even with admin QBO user on Advanced plan)
- `ReconciliationSummary` report: same 5020 error

**Next step to investigate**: Whether the 5020 error is due to (a) stale OAuth token — try fresh reconnect immediately before calling the endpoint, or (b) Intuit app review requirement — certain report endpoints may be locked until the app completes marketplace review.

Several debug endpoints exist on the live app (accounts-raw, gl-raw, account-raw, rec-summary, purchase, etc.) — these should be cleaned up before any real users are added.

### Update — 2026-06-18: Found a working data source, but account filtering is broken

Confirmed via Intuit docs/community research that the `TransactionList` report supports a `cleared` query parameter (`Reconciled` / `Cleared` / `Uncleared`) that correctly identifies reconciliation status — this is the right building block (no ReconcileStatus field exists elsewhere in the API).

Rebuilt `lib/reconciliation.js` to fetch `TransactionList` filtered by `cleared=Reconciled` to derive last-rec-date, and `cleared=Uncleared` for the unreconciled list. Found and fixed two real bugs along the way:
1. `cleared=UnCleared` is an invalid enum — must be `Uncleared` (lowercase c).
2. `parseRows()` was indexing report columns by `col.ColType` (e.g. "Date", "Money") instead of the actual `ColKey` in `col.MetaData` (e.g. "tx_date", "subt_nat_amount") — this silently zeroed out every transaction's amount and dropped all rows. Fixed.

**Current blocker**: After those fixes, every account returns *identical* data (same date, same 6288 transactions, same $30M sum) — meaning the `account=` filter parameter on the `TransactionList` report is not actually being respected by QBO's API (confirmed via web research: this is a known limitation, Intuit's own community has reported `TransactionList`'s account filter is unreliable).

**In progress when session ended**: Testing whether the `GeneralLedger` report (which we proved DOES correctly filter by `account=`) also accepts the `cleared` parameter — if so, combining `GeneralLedger` + `cleared` filter could give us correct per-account reconciliation data. Added debug endpoint `/api/gl-cleared-test/:id` to test this — not yet confirmed working as of end of session (last user report was "still the same issue" i.e. still identical results across accounts, but this was before fully verifying the GL-based endpoint specifically).

**Next session should start by**: hitting `/api/gl-cleared-test/750` and `/api/gl-cleared-test/1150040088` (two different real Shakuff accounts) and comparing — if GL+cleared gives genuinely distinct results per account, rewire `reconciliation.js` to use `fetchGeneralLedgerByCleared` instead of `fetchTransactionListByCleared`.

### Update — 2026-06-19: Confirmed — GeneralLedger + cleared filter works, reconciliation logic rewired

Hit `/api/gl-cleared-test/750` (Chase 5508 Operating) and `/api/gl-cleared-test/1150040088` (Citi 9850) directly against the real company. Results were genuinely distinct per account — Chase 5508 returned thousands of transactions back to 2017, Citi 9850 returned exactly one transaction ($176.59 on 2025-12-26). Confirms `GeneralLedger`'s `account=` filter is respected even with `cleared` applied, unlike `TransactionList`.

`lib/reconciliation.js` now uses `fetchGeneralLedgerByCleared` (was `fetchTransactionListByCleared`). `fetchTransactionListByCleared` and the `/api/cleared-test/:id` and `/api/gl-cleared-test/:id` debug endpoints were removed from `lib/qbo.js` and `routes/api.js` now that the approach is confirmed.

**Not yet verified**: a full end-to-end run of `/api/reconciliation` against the real company with the new GL-based logic — should be the first thing checked next session.

## Notes

- The reconciliation integrity check (detecting whether a reconciliation has been broken after the fact) is the most technically complex feature and may move to v2.
- Claude Code (in the Claude app) is the primary development environment.
- Credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) are **never** to be committed to GitHub or shared.
